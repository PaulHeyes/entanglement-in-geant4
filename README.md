# entanglement-in-geant4
Extension (or rather alteration) of Geant4 to incorporate quantum entanglement, more specifically, compton scattering of entangled photons.

Directly addressing the (first) elephant in the room: Originally the code was set up to simulate a Bell's experiment, though a far more appropriate naming concentrates on quantum entangled photons, which was then adopted at some point during this project. Hence half the classes are named something along the lines of 'bell_{usefulNaming}', while the rest are more aptly named. This is a little bit annoying, but was never rectified due to lazyness on the part of yours truly.
